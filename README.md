# Noughts and Crosses Game :space_invader:
**Tic-tac-toe** (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC.
